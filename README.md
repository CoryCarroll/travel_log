# `TraveLog`

This application is designed to, firstly, authenticate users before they enter the site. Once past the login prompt, a user would be able to create a wishlist of places they'd like to visit and store key pieces of information such as: cost, destination, landmarks, and duration. Users could create a history of places they've been and notes about their journeys.
